# Loki: The Trickster's Trial - Feature Ideas
(ai)
This document tracks potential features and enhancements for the Loki game.

## 1. Shapeshifting (The Ultimate Deception)
*   **Concept:** Add an "Identity Theft" mechanic where Loki can transform into an enemy he just defeated.
*   **Gameplay:** For 10 turns, other enemies ignore you. However, if you attack while transformed, you deal **Double Damage** but lose the disguise immediately.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"Why be yourself when you can be anyone else?"*

## 2. Mirror Image Decoys
*   **Concept:** A defensive ability (Key: 3) that creates 2-3 illusions of Loki on surrounding tiles.
*   **Gameplay:** Enemies will prioritize attacking the decoys. When a decoy "dies," it explodes in a cloud of green smoke, stunning any enemy within 1 tile for 2 turns.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"You're always one step behind, brother."*

## 3. The "TVA" Time-Loop Mechanic
*   **Concept:** If Loki dies, instead of a Game Over, a **TVA Hunter** appears and "resets" the floor.
*   **Gameplay:** You restart the current level, but the layout remains the same, and your "ghost" from the previous run is visible (doing exactly what you did before you died). You can use your ghost as a distraction to get past guards.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"I'm burdened with glorious... resets?"*

## 4. Jotunheim's Ice Mechanics
*   **Concept:** Introduce "Realm Variants" for levels. In a Jotunheim-themed floor, tiles are slippery.
*   **Gameplay:** When you move in a direction, you keep sliding until you hit a wall, an enemy, or a "dry" floor tile. This turns the maze into a sliding puzzle.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"A little frost never hurt a Prince of Asgard."*

## 5. Mind Control Scepter (Rare Loot)
*   **Concept:** A rare relic that replaces your daggers for a short time.
*   **Gameplay:** Instead of killing enemies, you can "turn" them. They will follow you and attack other enemies. However, it drains your "Mischief" bar rapidly.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"I'm going to need a bigger scepter."*

## 6. The "Silver Tongue" Dialogue System
*   **Concept:** Occasionally, "Elite" enemies won't attack immediately. They'll talk.
*   **Gameplay:** Use an LLM-backed dialogue system to create a high-stakes conversation. If you can convince the guard to let you pass (using logic, flattery, or threats), they leave a Rune behind and walk away. If you fail, they call reinforcements.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"Trust is for children."*

## 7. Tesseract Portals
*   **Concept:** Collect blue "Space Stone" fragments to spawn portals.
*   **Gameplay:** Place a portal at Point A and another at Point B. You (and smart enemies) can use them to traverse the maze instantly. 
*   **Loki Hook:** *"It’s called 'The Bifrost for Cowards'."*

## 8. "Glorious Purpose" Meter
*   **Concept:** A "Special Move" meter that builds up as you collect Runes.
*   **Gameplay:** When full, you can trigger a 5-second "God Mode" where time slows down, and every keypress teleports you to an adjacent tile instantly, allowing you to "blitz" through a room of enemies.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"I am a God, you dull creature!"*

## 9. Dynamic Fog of War (Helheim)
*   **Concept:** A level where visibility is limited to a 3x3 square around Loki.
*   **Gameplay:** You can see the glow of Runes through the fog, but enemies are invisible until they are right on top of you. You have to listen (audio cues) for their footsteps.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"Even the Goddess of Death can't hide from me."*

## 10. The Alligator Loki Pet
*   **Concept:** A rare "Friendship" event in the maze.
*   **Gameplay:** Find Alligator Loki in a hidden corner. He follows you and randomly bites the feet of enemies, dealing small continuous damage or causing them to miss their turns.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"He's green, he's mean, and he's... me?"*
