# Loki: The Trickster's Trial - Feature Ideas
(ai)

7 -10 is good 
This document tracks potential features and enhancements for the Loki game.

## 1. Jotunheim's Ice Mechanics
*   **Concept:** Introduce "Realm Variants" for levels. In a Jotunheim-themed floor, tiles are slippery.
*   **Gameplay:** When you move in a direction, you keep sliding until you hit a wall, an enemy, or a "dry" floor tile. This turns the maze into a sliding puzzle.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"A little frost never hurt a Prince of Asgard."*


## 2. Tesseract Portals
*   **Concept:** Collect blue "Space Stone" fragments to spawn portals.
*   **Gameplay:** Place a portal at Point A and another at Point B. You (and smart enemies) can use them to traverse the maze instantly. 
*   **Loki Hook:** *"It’s called 'The Bifrost for Cowards'."*


## 3. Dynamic Fog of War (Helheim)
*   **Concept:** A level where visibility is limited to a 3x3 square around Loki.
*   **Gameplay:** You can see the glow of Runes through the fog, but enemies are invisible until they are right on top of you. You have to listen (audio cues) for their footsteps.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"Even the Goddess of Death can't hide from me."*

## 4. The Alligator Loki Pet
*   **Concept:** A rare "Friendship" event in the maze.
*   **Gameplay:** Find Alligator Loki in a hidden corner. He follows you and randomly bites the feet of enemies, dealing small continuous damage or causing them to miss their turns.
*   **Loki Hook:** *"He's green, he's mean, and he's... me?"*
