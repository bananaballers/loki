# Loki: The Trickster's Trial

Welcome to **Loki: The Trickster's Trial**, a 2D Norse adventure game where you step into the role of the God of Mischief himself. Navigate treacherous mazes across the Nine Realms, outsmart your enemies, and collect enough Runes to prove your worth.

## Overview

Loki has been cast into a series of labyrinthine trials. To escape, he must traverse various realms, each with its own unique atmospheric challenges and environmental quirks. From the frozen plains of Jotunheim to the misty depths of Helheim, every level is a test of wit and reflexes.

Created by **Veer, Drew, John, and Alexander**.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Multidimensional Realms**: Experience different gameplay mechanics based on the realm:
    *   **Jotunheim**: Slippery ice floors make movement a puzzle.
    *   **Helheim**: Limited visibility requires careful navigation.
    *   **Niflheim**: Low visibility mist.
    *   **Muspelheim**: Increased enemy aggression.
*   **The Tesseract Portals**: Collect **Space Stone** fragments to activate portals that let you warp across levels.
*   **The Gatekeeper's Challenge**: Advancing to the next realm isn't just about finding the exit; you must answer the Gatekeeper's questions correctly to proceed safely.
*   **Glorious Arsenal**: Battle enemies using daggers and other weapons found within the trials.
*   **Hall of Heroes**: Compete for the high score on the global leaderboard (saved via Firebase).

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Movement**: Navigate Loki through the maze.
2.  **Collection**: Pick up Runes (Score), Daggers (Weapons), and Potions (Health).
3.  **Portals**: Use the Space Stone fragments to skip ahead when the odds are against you.
4.  **Questions**: When you reach a gate, be prepared to prove your knowledge of the mythos.
