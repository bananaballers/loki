        <h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Classroom</h4>

        <p>
            York School recognizes the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
            enhancing teaching and learning. Recent advances in AI technology,
            however, have given students and teachers access to tools that may
            jeopardize an authentic picture of students’ understanding if misused.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unless explicitly stated by teachers for a particular assignment,
            students should operate on the assumption that AI is not allowed to be used.
        </p>

        <p>
            Students are expected to acknowledge any AI usage, verify the accuracy
            of AI-generated content, and use AI ethically. Failure to disclose AI
            use may be treated as a violation of academic integrity policies.
        </p>
